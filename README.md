# Tale-of-Beginnings-AHK-
An RPG made entirely in Autohotkey.

This is a personal project in which I want to improve on my Autohotkey skills. I am looking to improve myself with the language to a degree where I can consider the language mastered.

Here is what the game currently has:
  1. A fancy title screen, with AI generated BGM.
  2. Continue, New Game, Options buttons.
  3. Options button allows user to turn off BGM currently.
  4. Lots of RNG like any game should have.
  5. Monsters appear with a message such as "A shiver runs down your spine..you turn around to find yourself face to face with a monstrous wolf!". Also, many monsters have several variations of these to shake things up and make monster encounters more interesting.
  6. A map with some icons.
  7. Permadeath mode.
  8. Some monsters, items, equipment.
  9. More coming soon. I will upload when what I have is in a more complete state. Follow to test when it drops!
